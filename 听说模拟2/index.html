My working hours aren’t necessarily much shorter than they once were but I spend fewer of them at the office. This lets me share more time with my younger daughter than I might have if she’d been born before electronic mail became such a practical tool.The Internet also makes it easy to share thoughts with a group of friends. Say you do something fun — see a great movie perhaps — and there are four or five friends who might want to hear about it. If you call each one, you might be tired of telling the story.
