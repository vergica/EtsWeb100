Along with nine other children whose parents were also famous scholars, Irene studied in their own school, and her mother was one of the teachers. Irene finished her high school education at a college in Paris. Then she entered the university to prepare for a degree in mathematics and physics. When World War I began, Irene went to help her mother, who was using X-ray machines to help save the wounded soldiers. And after the war, she continued her work by developing X-ray machines, which were important in medical treatments. In 1918, Irene became her mother’s assistant at the Curie Institute. Like her mother, Irene managed to balance family and career. Like her mother, Irene was awarded a Noble Prize in 1935.
