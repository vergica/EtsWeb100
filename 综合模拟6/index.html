The business district of an American city is crowded with large office buildings which are filled with banks, corporation headquarters, and government agencies. Every weekday morning thousands of office workers enter these buildings and leave in the evening. The men and women who do the office work are called white-collar workers. Secretaries, computer operators and administrators are all white-collar workers. Many office workers work and hope that they will be promoted to more responsible positions. They want to supervise other workers and see that the company policies are carried out. These policies are established by the top managers. Sometimes office workers are transferred to other places. Nowadays, education is emphasized in the selection of men and women for management jobs. Courses in business administration are offered by many universities. The graduates of these courses are often placed in middle management jobs. From these, they can be promoted easily when they show the necessary personality and ability."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/507e24852435e26e6761ade703c0e438/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.

I can decide when to open and close it, and which kinds of bread and drinks to sell. It is wonderful, isn’t it?", "If you ask me whether I want to be a white-collar worker or not in the future, my answer would be yes. Two reasons are responsible for this. First, white-collar workers usually deal with all kinds of projects every day. That’s what I enjoy doing, because it makes me feel confident and valuable. Secondly, it’s more possible that white-collar workers can get higher payment. Therefore, I’ll be able to invite my family to go travelling more often. I’ll major in business in my university, and after my graduation I’ll go to a company and work as a white-collar worker.", "No. I don’t want to be a white-collar worker. The reasons are as follows. First, white-collar workers are often under high pressure. Second, they may be so busy that they don’t have enough time for breakfast and lunch, which is not good for health. What’s more, most white-collar workers stay in the office and sit on chairs for about eight hours a day, then they may feel uncomfortable on their heads, shoulders, and hands after work.
