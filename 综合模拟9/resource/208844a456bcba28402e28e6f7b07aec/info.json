[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>Earlier this month, we had our first cultural orientation camp. We played some games to break the ice. The most exciting one was the Blinder Game. We were separated into eight groups, each with three people. One of them must close his or her eyes to act “blind ”. Then the other two must help him or her walk through obstacles and tasks.</br></p><p>In my group, I was the “blind” one. When I couldn’t see anything, my fears came out. But my teammates gave me their hands and led me every step of the way. I began to trust them. Through this game, I learned trust itself is a process. I got closer to my teammates through this activity.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
