[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">Mrs. Hobson teaches within the state system. The children in these schools may have special physical difficulties, or they may have emotional and intelligence problem. The teachers are specially trained and they work together with teams of psychiatrists and doctors who study the problems and development of each child. These schools try to get the child back into the normal state system as soon as possible. If this cannot be done, the child will still get an education specially designed for his or her problems.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">Mrs. Hobson is particularly concerned with children who are extremely aggressive â€” so aggressive that a normal school cannot deal with them. She also teaches another kind of child who might be considered to be the exact opposite of aggressive, the so-called autistic child. A normal school cannot deal with an autistic child either. Both the aggressive and the autistic child are Mrs. Hobson's special concern. </p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 Who does Mrs. Hobson teach in the school?</br>ets_th2 What do you think of Mrs. Hobson's job?
