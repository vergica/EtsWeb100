In 1900, for example, women spent almost all of their adult lives in having and taking care of children. This would go on until she was 55, if she was lucky enough to live that long.In 1900, women had no right to vote. They could not even own property in marriage. The husband was the breadwinner and the lord and master. Women got the right to vote after the First World War. Other rights followed more slowly.In 1900, the only professional jobs open to women were in teaching. There were no women lawyers, engineers or architects. No women had high positions in politics. Today, women seem to have the best professional chances in education, as teachers and professors, in medicine, as doctors. Other good jobs for women can be found in the new industries like computers. Many of the top computer programmers and specialists are women. Women are also slowly winning some of the top positions in politics."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/222a08eb2e6add451204ce790eefed7c/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
