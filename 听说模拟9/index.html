Every year in September or October, the Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated as a day for family reunions. In the past, people all over China looked forward to eating moon cakes and watching the moon with their families. But nowadays people are celebrating the festival in modern ways. One way many people choose is to travel during the festival. As a result, scenic spots across China become crowded. Traffic in many areas becomes busy due to the huge numbers of people on the roads. Another popular way to celebrate the festival is to do shopping. There are lots of holiday sales. Usually people can enjoy considerate services specially offered for the holiday in different shopping malls. They don’t keep time for a big family reunion, since they no longer think a big family dinner is a necessity for this special day. However, a professor from Nankai University warns that festivals cannot be celebrated just for fun. He says that we should keep the valuable elements of the traditional festivals and preserve them for future generations. He also suggests that children should be taught about traditional festivals in kindergarten.
