Community colleges have become popular and their enrollments have increased rapidly. Large universities are offering more courses in the evenings for adult students. In this way, the demand for more education is being met. One reason for this is that many elder people are changing their professions. They are looking for different careers. Another reason is that repair costs have increased. Adults are taking courses like plumbing and electrical repair. In this way they hope that the high costs for repairs can be avoided. Technology is the most important reason for the rise in adult education. Engineers, teachers and businessmen are taking adult education classes. They have found that more education is needed to do their jobs well. Various courses are offered. Computer and business courses are taken by many adult students. Foreign languages, accounting and communication courses are also popular. Some students attend classes to earn degrees. Others take courses for the knowledge and skills that they can receive. The lives of many people have been enriched because of adult education."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/866acd861577d5194d54f4448c0cdcf5/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.

There are three reasons for this. Above all, I have seen some French films, and I think French is so beautiful. So it would be fascinating if I could speak fluent French. Secondly, I have great interest in Victor Hugo’s novels. I hope that one day I am able to read his novels in French, rather than the ones which are translated. Thirdly, I think mastering a foreign language will do good to my work in the future.", "I’d like to take a computer course in the future. There are mainly two reasons. First of all, computer skills are playing a more and more important role in our study and work. We can do things better and faster if we have great computer skills. Secondly, my computer skills are poor. I don’t use a computer often, so I am only familiar with some basic skills. I want to be more proficient in computer. Therefore, I really want to take a computer course in the future.", "The adult education I’d like to take in the future is a communication course, especially the art of public speaking. The reasons are as follows. To begin with, in my opinion, speaking doesn’t only mean a speaker stands in front of the audience, and delivers the speech; it also means our daily speaking to different people. So it’ll be helpful in my daily communication if I learn some speaking skills. Second, I believe that the communication skills I learn in the course will also benefit my future career. So I’d like to take a communication course in the future.", "In the future, I want to take a nursing care course. Two reasons are responsible for this. Firstly, I am ready to help others and I’d like to visit Old People’s Home as a volunteer when I’m free in the future. So I need to know some nursing skills before that. Secondly, I enjoy taking care of others, and I am interested in nursing care. Although now I want to be a teacher, maybe I will change my career to be a nurse in the future.
