[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">During last summer holiday, I was working as a volunteer at a camp in France, teaching sports activities to children aged 9 to 11. The camp was situated in an area close to a long, sandy beach.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The days at the camp were long and I had to get up at 6:30, and was not usually in bed before midnight. I often had no time to eat lunch, except perhaps for a sandwich. I taught swimming in the morning and basketball in the afternoon. I also spent my evenings with these children, playing games, watching videos and singing. One of the reasons I was accepted for the job was that I can play the guitar. Generally my happiest times during the day were after dinner when the whole group went to the beach and chatted and sang.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The whole experience has made me think seriously about teaching as a job in the future. </p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 Describe a typical day the speaker spent at the camp.</br>ets_th2 Imagine you are working as a volunteer in a nursing home, what can you learn from this volunteer experience?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 Describe a typical day the speaker spent at the camp.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 Imagine you are working as a volunteer in a nursing home, what can you learn from this volunteer experience?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
