Rome was the center of a huge empire. The Romans needed a way to move their large armies quickly so that they could protect their country. They also needed roads for land trade. Therefore, the emperor decided to build a net-work of roads.</br><\/p><p>Beginning in 300 B.C., the Romans built roads in Europe, Asia and North Africa. By 200 A.D., they had built 50,000 miles of almost straight roads.</br><\/p><p>To build their roads, the Romans moved away all soft soil. They dug until they reached the hard ground. Then they added layers of stone. The most important roads were paved with large flat stones. Main Roman roads were sometimes as wide as ours today. Sometimes, the Romans had to dig tunnels through mountains. But they didn’t have any machines to help them. So they heated the rock with fire and then threw cold water over it. When the rock cracked, they dug it out. It was hard work, but the roads were so well built that they were used for hundreds of years.","stid":"51532","audio":"content.mp3"}}
