Nearly half of the high school graduates in America go on to college. Most students, like Bob and Jenny, go to large universities. These are state universities. Some of them have 40,000 or more students. There are also many small universities with only a few hundred students. Large universities have many teaching buildings, each building for a particular subject. The buildings are in the university campus. Often, students must go from one class in one building to the next class in another building across the campus. They may have only a few minutes between classes to go from one building to another. When students begin university, they must take classes in many different subjects. These are the required courses. English and math are usually required courses. In addition, a history and a science course are often required, too. Bob and Jenny will mainly study these required courses during their first year. Later, they will specialize and take courses in one subject, that is, their major subject. "}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/560bbd0e9107a7dcda5042c09dac104d/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.

Do you plan to study in America in the future? Why?"}, "ans2": {"std": ["Yes, I do. I have dreamed about going to university in America since I was in junior high school. On one hand, I like the learning environment in American universities. On the other hand, students there have more free time to take part in after-school activities. It’s different from the situation in Chinese universities. I think that’s very important to us. We need to study, but we also need to relax.", "No, I don’t have such a plan. I love my country. And I love my family, too. I don’t want to stay far away from them. I prefer Chinese colleges to American ones. Besides, we also have many good schools in China. We can receive good education here. So there’s no need to go to college in the USA. Students can work hard and improve themselves in our colleges as well. Why not just study here in China?", "Yes, I’d like to go for further study in the US. Because I love English and I’m interested in everything about America. It’s an amazing country and I want to know more about it. So it is good to live and study in the country. I heard that university courses in America are more interesting than those in China. There are more choices of courses in the US than in China, too. Then I can study what I like in college. Therefore, studying in an American college is a good choice for me.", "Yes, I have a plan like that. First of all, the United States has the most famous universities. Some of them are among the top ten in the world. Second, universities in the United States focus more on students’ personal improvement than school reports. I think this is important to us, for we need more skills to live in the world. We should do more things than just study. So I plan to study in America in the near future and I’m working hard for that.", "No, I don’t want to study in America. First, I think colleges and universities in our country are good enough. We can also learn a lot in them if we concentrate on what we study. Second, we might experience great culture shocks when we study in American colleges, because we have very different cultures. Many of us may not be used to the life there. But this will never happen if we stay in our country. So I will choose Chinese universities instead of American ones."], "key": "To Study in America"}}, "4": {"title": "情景描述", "pic0": "resource/bb00edd19b34fc291a8333cf5076db50/material/content.jpg", "pic1": "resource/bb00edd19b34fc291a8333cf5076db50/material/content_1.jpg", "pic2": "resource/bb00edd19b34fc291a8333cf5076db50/material/content_2.jpg", "pic3": "resource/bb00edd19b34fc291a8333cf5076db50/material/content_3.jpg", "pic4": "resource/bb00edd19b34fc291a8333cf5076db50/material/content_4.jpg", "dir": "resource/bb00edd19b34fc291a8333cf5076db50/material/content.mp3", "ans": ["One day Tom was kicking a ball under a tree.
