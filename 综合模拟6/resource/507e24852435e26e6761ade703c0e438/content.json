The business district of an American city is crowded with large office buildings which are filled with banks, corporation headquarters, and government agencies. Every weekday morning thousands of office workers enter these buildings and leave in the evening. The men and women who do the office work are called white-collar workers. Secretaries, computer operators and administrators are all white-collar workers. Many office workers work and hope that they will be promoted to more responsible positions. They want to supervise other workers and see that the company policies are carried out. These policies are established by the top managers. Sometimes office workers are transferred to other places. Nowadays, education is emphasized in the selection of men and women for management jobs. Courses in business administration are offered by many universities. The graduates of these courses are often placed in middle management jobs. From these, they can be promoted easily when they show the necessary personality and ability.","stid":"51726","audio":"content.mp3"}}
