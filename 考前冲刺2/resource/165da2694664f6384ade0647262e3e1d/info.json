They offered food and shelter to travellers. The food was usually simple and the travellers had to share beds with other travellers. The service was friendly, but the accommodation lacked comfort and convenience that travellers expect today.</br></p><p>Travel has always been considered to be of help to increase one’s knowledge and broaden one’s mind.

Some people would like to travel as part of a tour group while others prefer to travel independently.</br></p><p>People travel for different purposes. People may travel entirely for sightseeing. They are often holiday tourists. People may travel around the world for business. They include businessmen, government officials and professional personnel attending meetings. People may travel for improving their health. Most of them are sick or elderly persons. They prefer to find a quiet and clean place for a short stay instead of touring here and there.</br></p><p>Now listen again please.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What are two of the reasons for people to travel?</br>ets_th2 Would you like to travel independently?
