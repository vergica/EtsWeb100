Wilson was born in 1930 on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in Shields, North Dakota. She grew up hearing native stories from her mother and grandparents. Wilson’s mother told her stories of the plants and animals she saw while traveling to and from work. Through these stories, Wilson learned the values, beliefs, history, and language of her culture.</br></p><p>Today Wilson shares what she has learned whenever she can. She hosts Native-language radio programs and records stories in two languages on CDs for all to hear. Storytelling has played a large role in her work as a teacher and as the director of a number of programs. For her, storytelling is a way of life.</br></p><p>Wilson believes that the stories she tells convey valuable lessons. They teach history and reveal the interconnection of all life forms. Many stories she shares tell about local sites. One story about a rock near Fort Ransom, North Dakota, is of a woman who turned herself to stone because of her love of nature. Another tells of a woman who lived with a family of wolves on a local hill. Each of the stories she tells conveys a respect for nature, others, and for one’s homeland, culture, and history.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"xh":"1","sucai":"ques1Std1.mp3,ques1Std2.mp3","role":"b","ask":"1.
