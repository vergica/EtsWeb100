[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about mangrove trees.</br></p><p>You can imagine how hard it is for plants to grow along muddy, saltwater shores. First, it is difficult for plants to grow in mud without falling over. Second, plants that grow on land require freshwater, not salt water. But mangrove trees have succeeded where other plants have failed.</br></p><p>Mangroves have developed specialized ways of coping with their muddy environment. Mangrove roots are shallow. They grow into a mass that “floats” in mud, somewhat like a small boat. The roots are covered with a bark that resists the acids that form in the mud. Some species have “breathing roots”, which grow straight out of the mud. Most mangrove species get rid of the salt in salt water by forcing it out through their leaves.</br></p><p>There are 34 species of mangrove trees. Mangroves grow along the coasts of Florida as well as in other tropical areas around the world. They cannot tolerate cold climates.</br></p><p>The mangrove trees create a rich place for many creatures to survive. Their root systems provide a perfect nursery for baby fish. Mangroves also create a good home for some animals, such as snakes and bats.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 How do mangrove trees manage to survive in the muddy, saltwater shores?</br>ets_th2 Would you like to grow a plant at home?
