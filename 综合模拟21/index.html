Nevertheless, it has been said that today children interrupt their education to go to school. The distinction between schooling and education implied by this remark is important.Education is much more open-ended and all-inclusive than schooling. Education can take place anywhere, whether in the shower or in the job, whether in a kitchen or a tractor. The agents of education can range from a revered grandparent to the people debating politics on the radio, from a child to a distinguished scientist.Whereas schooling has a certain predictability, education quite often produces surprises. A chance conversation with a stranger may lead a person to discover how little is known of other religions. Education, then, is a very broad, inclusive term. People are engaged in education from infancy on. It is a lifelong process, a process that starts long before the start of school and one that should be an integral part of one’s entire life. Schooling, on the other hand, is a specific, formalized process.
