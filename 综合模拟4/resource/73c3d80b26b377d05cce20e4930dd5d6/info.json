[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about craft fairs.</br></p><p>For a long time Americans preferred things which were mass-produced in factories. But recently many Americans have taken up crafts of various kinds. The works of these crafts-people have become very popular. They are sold at craft fairs. Some fairs are small. Usually they are held in shopping centers or churches. At large fairs, several hundred crafts-people assemble their works for people to admire and buy. These fairs are held in public parks or on county grounds. Craft fairs are usually held on weekends when people are free from work and looking for things to do. The fairs are directed toward families. So they offer rides and shows for children to keep them busy while their parents are shopping for the crafts. The crafts that people buy include things to decorate their homes, clothes for their children, and gifts for their friends or for holidays, weddings or special occasions. People go to craft fairs rather than shopping at stores because they look for things that are different and original. They also look out for bargains. The prices for works of art at craft fairs are usually very reasonable.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 Why do people go to craft fairs?</br>ets_th2 Do you like shopping at stores or online?
