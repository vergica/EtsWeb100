Others angrily blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none of them did anything to help with it.</br><\/p><p>A young man then came along, carrying a load of vegetables.

After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.</br><\/p><p>When he was back, he found a packet, right at the place where the rock used to be. He opened it. The packet contained plenty of gold coins and a note from the King, explaining that the coins were for the person who removed the rock away.</br><\/p><p>Every obstacle we come across in life gives us an opportunity to improve our circumstances, and while the lazy complain, the others are getting things done with their kindness, generosity, and willingness.","stid":"217411","audio":"content.mp3"}}
