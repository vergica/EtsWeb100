Facts show that windmills began to use in ancient Iran back in the 7th century BC. They were first introduced to Europe during the 1100s, when armies returned from the Middle East with knowledge of using wind power. For many centuries, people used windmills to grind wheat or pump water. When electricity was discovered in the late 1800s, people living in remote areas began to use windmills to produce electricity. This allowed them to have electric lights and radio. However, by the 1940s when electricity was available to people in almost all areas in the United States, windmills were rarely used. During the 1970s, people started becoming concerned about the pollution that was created when coal and gas were used to produce electricity. People also realized that the supply of coal and gas would not last forever. Then people began to use wind to produce electricity again, though it means higher costs. Today, there is a global movement to supply more and more of our electricity through the use of wind.","stid":"81381","audio":"content.mp3"}}
