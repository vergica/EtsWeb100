The major difference is that instruction is delivered online. Online courses allow you to learn whenever, wherever, and however works best for you, making it easier to earn a degree while balancing work and family commitments. Online courses present challenges if you’re not prepared. Here are some tips for online learning success to make sure you get the most value out of your next class.First, keep an open mind. Online learning provides students with the time they need to actively reflect and organize their thoughts before answering questions. Learners who approach online learning with an open mind are more likely to be successful. Second, create space to learn. Invest some time up front to understand your needs and preferences as a learner, and what an effective study environment looks like for you. For example, you might need a quiet place to study, or you might need to listen to classical music. Third, manage your time effectively. Spend some time getting familiar with your online courses, understanding what is expected of you, mapping out key due dates, and planning study time."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/65a4c4d83f9780fd5153767c46dc120b/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
