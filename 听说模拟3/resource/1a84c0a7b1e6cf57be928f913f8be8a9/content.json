Firstly, I don’t like cold weather at all because we have to wear many clothes to keep ourselves warm. And it’s freezing cold when the snow is melting, which is inconvenient for outdoor activities. Secondly, it affects the traffic on the road and delays our trains and flights. That will be terrible when we have something urgent. Thirdly, snow and ice can do harm to the crops in the fields. Farmers suffer a great loss when there’s too much snow.","ai":"<\/p><p>Yes, it does. Here are my reasons.

For some countries it is an important happening to celebrate each year, while for others it is a disaster.</br><\/p><p>However, Britain is between these two kinds, which never receives snow regularly or in the same quantities every year. For it, the arrival of snow quite simply creates problems. The roads are blocked, and trains and buses have to stop in the middle of the way. Phone calls become difficult and the post takes more time than usual. There are also certain shortages — bread, vegetables and other things — not because they can no longer be produced or sent to shops, but mainly because people are frightened and store up food “just for fear that something bad would happen”.</br><\/p><p>But why does snow have this effect? It is simply because there is not enough planning and preparation. It takes money to buy equipment to deal with snow and ice, for example, snow ploughs and machines to spread salt. The reason why a country like Britain does not buy snow ploughs is that they are only used for a few days in any one year, and that money could be more useful for other necessary things.","stid":"81416","audio":"content.mp3"}}
