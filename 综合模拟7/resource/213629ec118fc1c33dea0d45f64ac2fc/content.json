Parents raising five or more children were common. Over the years the size of the family has decreased. One reason for this is an increase in the cost of living. On average, children attend schools for more years than they used to, making them financially dependent on their families longer. Moreover, children nowadays are better dressed and have more money to spend on entertainment. The parents usually take the responsibility for all the expenses. Meanwhile, families are less close than they used to be. More and more American mothers work away from home. The break up of the family occurs when the parents get divorced. A lot of children in the U.S. live part of their young lives with only one parent. Broken families usually result in problems for children and parents alike. Children blame themselves when their parents separate. They grow up feeling unsettled as they are moved back and forth between parents. Usually one parent takes the responsibility for raising the children. These single parents must care for the children’s emotional and psychological needs while also supporting them financially.","stid":"51723","audio":"content.mp3"}}
