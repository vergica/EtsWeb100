They build their homes about 4.6m above the river, an important feature for the safety of the young. It is called the hoatzin.</br><\/p><p>In appearance, the birds of both sexes look very much alike with brown on the back and cream and red on the underside. The head is small, with a large set of features on the top, bright red eyes, and blue skin. They are like the common birds, cuckoos. Its most striking feature, though, is only found in the young.</br><\/p><p>Baby hoatzins have a claw on the leading edge of each wing and another at the end of each wing tip. Using these four claws, together with the beak, they can climb about in the bushes, looking very much like primitive birds must have done. When the young hoatzins have learned to fly, they lose their claws.","stid":"81390","audio":"content.mp3"}}
