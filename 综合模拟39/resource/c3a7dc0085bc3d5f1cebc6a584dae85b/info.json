[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">Most parents, I suppose, have had experienced of reading a bedtime story to their children. And they must have realized how difficult it is to write a good children's book. Either the author has aimed too high, so that children can't follow the story, or seems to be talking down to the readers.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The best children's books keep a balance between these two: to satisfy both the child who hears the story and the adult who reads it. However, there are very few books like this, so the problem of finding a suitable bedtime story is not easy to solve.
