But what happens when that interest becomes the most important thing in your life?<\/p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">Take Bob Martin for example, in 1988, he went to see the musical <i>Cats<\/i> at the New London Theatre. He enjoyed it so much that he went to see it again, and again, and again ... every week for fourteen years! He travelled 52,000 miles and saw the show 795 times, spending a total of £20,000. I don't drink, smoke or run a car, so I could just about afford it,\" says the 71-year-old. But sadly, Bob is now looking for a new hobby. The show closed last year after a sixteen-year run in London.<\/p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">For some, it's musicals that keep them coming back for more. For others, it's...fast food. Peter Holden, from Washington DC, eats an average of two McDonald's meals a day. He has eaten more than 11000 McDonalds and says, \"I'm a collector of the McDonald dining experience.\" He is 1.9 meters tall and weighs 90 kilograms — he says he doesn't put on weight partly because he is lucky and partly because he doesn't eat the fries.<\/p>","stid":"284082","audio":"content.mp3"}}
