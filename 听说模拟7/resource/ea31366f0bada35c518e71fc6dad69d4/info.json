Therefore, these bikes are popular with commuters, many of whom use them to cover the distance between subway stations or bus stops and offices or homes. But the lack of bicycle parking lots — most of which have made way for car parking lots — poses a challenge to cyclists. The disorderly parking of such bikes on street corners has created a problem for urban administrative officers, who do not have enough people to manage the cyclists and tell them to park the bikes in the right places. Officers in Chengdu, Southwest China’s Sichuan province, confiscated hundreds of the bikes in November, because they were “illegally occupying public places”. But bike-sharing remains popular in Chengdu three months later.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What are the two main advantages of shared bicycles?</br>ets_th2 Do you like riding a shared bicycle?
