{"structure_type":"collector.dialogue","info":{"stid":"51734","value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about American women.</br></p><p>America has been called a democracy since its independence more than 200 years ago. However, at that time, only men were permitted to vote. Only men could own land and practice most professions. Women could not get a higher education or hold public office. The woman’s place was considered to be the home. Through the history of our country, many American women have worked to reduce the restrictions that society placed on them. They have met opposition. Slowly, however, the opportunities for women have increased. Colleges and universities were established for women. Later women were admitted to schools originally established only for men. In the early part of this century, American women were finally allowed to vote. Today, many women in America hold important positions or are pursuing careers that they could not pursue in the past. But many women are dissatisfied with the current situation. They point out that women are often paid less than men for the same work they do. The top positions in nearly all fields are still overwhelmingly held by men. In some places, a woman’s life is still dominated by her father or her husband.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"xh":"1","sucai":"ques1Std1.mp3,ques1Std2.mp3","role":"b","ask":"1.
