It was England that devised the rules for modern-day football and from that time onwards, football evolved rapidly.Football is a great game. Playing football can not only keep people healthy and fit but also strengthen the team spirit among the players. The football match is normally played for 90 minutes. Each team consists of 11 players and the players have to hit the ball with their foot or head and are supposed to kick or hit the ball into the rival team’s goal to score a goal. There is a goalkeeper present for each team to prevent the ball from entering the goal. The goalkeeper can stop the ball with their hands. However, other players cannot touch or hit the ball with their hands or arms. A team that scores more goals is considered to be the winner of the match.Playing football can benefit us in many ways related to health and fitness. It can also enhance the powers of concentration and sometimes improves the overall well-being of a person. People should engage in this game if they want to lose weight, build up lean muscle mass and live a happy life."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/9af134eb831a56a84dd465355698d561/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
