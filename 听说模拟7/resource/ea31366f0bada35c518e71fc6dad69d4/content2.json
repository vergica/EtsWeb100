Therefore, these bikes are popular with commuters, many of whom use them to cover the distance between subway stations or bus stops and offices or homes. But the lack of bicycle parking lots — most of which have made way for car parking lots — poses a challenge to cyclists. The disorderly parking of such bikes on street corners has created a problem for urban administrative officers, who do not have enough people to manage the cyclists and tell them to park the bikes in the right places. Officers in Chengdu, Southwest China’s Sichuan province, confiscated hundreds of the bikes in November, because they were “illegally occupying public places”. But bike-sharing remains popular in Chengdu three months later.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"They are easy to find and they can be rented at a low price.","ai":"They are easy to find and they can be rented at a low price.","audio":"ques1Std1.mp3"},{"value":"Shared bicycles are easy to find and they can be rented at a low price.","ai":"Shared bicycles are easy to find and they can be rented at a low price.","audio":"ques1Std2.mp3"},{"value":"Shared bicycles can be rented at a low price and they are easy to find.","ai":"Shared bicycles can be rented at a low price and they are easy to find.","audio":""},{"value":"They can be rented at a low price and are easy to find.","ai":"They can be rented at a low price and are easy to find.","audio":""},{"value":"It is easy to find shared bicycles and people can rent them at a low price.","ai":"It is easy to find shared bicycles and people can rent them at a low price.","audio":""},{"value":"People can rent shared bicycles at a low price and it is easy for them to find shared bicycles.","ai":"People can rent shared bicycles at a low price and it is easy for them to find shared bicycles.","audio":""},{"value":"People can rent shared bicycles at a low price and find them easily.","ai":"People can rent shared bicycles at a low price and find them easily.","audio":""},{"value":"It is easy to find shared bicycles and they are cheap to be rented.","ai":"It is easy to find shared bicycles and they are cheap to be rented.","audio":""},{"value":"Shared bicycles are cheap to be rented and it is easy for people to find them.","ai":"Shared bicycles are cheap to be rented and it is easy for people to find them.","audio":""},{"value":"They are easy to find and cheap to rent.","ai":"They are easy to find and cheap to rent.","audio":""},{"value":"Shared bicycles are easy to find and cheap to rent.","ai":"Shared bicycles are easy to find and cheap to rent.","audio":""},{"value":"They are easy to find and inexpensive to rent.","ai":"They are easy to find and inexpensive to rent.","audio":""},{"value":"They are inexpensive to rent and easy to find.","ai":"They are inexpensive to rent and easy to find.","audio":""},{"value":"Shared bicycles are easy to find and inexpensive to rent.","ai":"Shared bicycles are easy to find and inexpensive to rent.","audio":""},{"value":"Shared bicycles are inexpensive to rent and easy to find.","ai":"Shared bicycles are inexpensive to rent and easy to find.","audio":""}],"ref":[],"ask":"1.
