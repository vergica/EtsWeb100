Here are some general road rules you need to know when driving in the U.S. The most common one is the speed limit. The speed limit regulates how fast a car may go. The maximum speed limit in most states in America is sixty-five miles per hour. It is important to watch your speed, as it is strongly monitored by the speed radar. In most American states, sixteen is the minimum driving age, while in China, it is eighteen. Seat belt use is an important rule you should pay attention to. Forty-nine states have passed laws requiring seat belt use by at least all occupants of the front seat. In addition, most states require children to wear seat belts in the back seats. Last but not least, drunk driving is illegal in all American states. Although the penalties vary from state to state, some states require jail time and larger fines, even on a first offense.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"In America, the maximum speed limit is sixty-five miles per hour.
