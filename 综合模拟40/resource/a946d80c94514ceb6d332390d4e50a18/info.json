[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">In my first year in high school, I was fascinated with video games. I played them day and night and I wasn't studying enough. I was failing mathematics, which was my hardest subject. But I wanted to go to a good university. It means I must do well in mathematics. I know my mathematics score could play an important role in determining whether or not I was able to be accepted by a good university. However, I couldn't give up playing video games. I was completely torn. Then I found an excuse. See, the only class I was doing really badly in was math. I was Okay with other subjects. I wouldn't take mathematics as major and I might learn computer game designing in the university.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What exact conflict did the speaker have between what he was doing and what he should do?</br>ets_th2 Give an example of any conflict you have experienced between what you are doing and what you should do.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 What exact conflict did the speaker have between what he was doing and what he should do?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 Give an example of any conflict you have experienced between what you are doing and what you should do.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
