[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p><p>An earthquake happens when the earth actually moves under the ground. Many hundreds of earthquakes take place every year, especially under the sea. We don't even know that they are happening. If earthquakes happen in or near large cities, they can cause problems. The moving ground makes buildings shake and fall down. It causes cracks in the ground which may open up into very deep holes. People, animals and objects can fall into these holes and be lost forever. Water, gas and electricity pipes may be damaged. The result is flooding and fire. Fire is the greatest danger during an earthquake, because it can destroy so much in such a short time.</p></p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
