For instance, if they are learning about dinosaurs, the best way to wrap up the unit is to go on a field trip to a local dinosaur exhibit at the museum. This way they can get a hands-on view of everything they learned and help them connect what theyâ€™ve learned to what they are seeing at the exhibit.</br></p><p>Here are two fun and exciting educational field trip ideas for students.</br></p><p>Post Office. A field trip to the local Post Office is a great way for students to compare the history of the postal service with the technology they use today. Students will leave the Post Office with a better understanding of how the mail connects everyone in the world.</br></p><p>Pick Your Own Farms. A unique field trip idea is to take students on a trip to pick their own fruits and vegetables. Students will be exposed to agricultural topics and experience nature and how food grows. A hands-on trip to a local farm is the perfect way to end the nutrition unit.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What is the purpose of mentioning the dinosaur exhibit at the museum?</br>ets_th2 Besides Post Office and Pick Your Own Farms, what place do you think is also suitable for students to have a field trip?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 What is the purpose of mentioning the dinosaur exhibit at the museum?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 Besides Post Office and Pick Your Own Farms, what place do you think is also suitable for students to have a field trip?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
