They asked their friends, Nancy and her husband, to go with them. On Sunday morning, Henry’s wife, Kate, got up early to prepare sandwiches for the picnic. She asked Henry to get some soft drinks. Henry told her that they were in the refrigerator. Then Kate asked him to get the picnic basket ready. She also reminded him that he should put paper plates and napkins in it. At 10 o’clock in the morning, Nancy called Henry and told him that she would like to bring something to the picnic. Kate called her back and asked her to bring a bottle of wine. Nancy and her husband arrived at noon. The two families went to a nearby park. A small river ran through the park. There were tables and benches under the trees beside the river. The weather was cloudy but it didn’t rain. Everybody enjoyed the picnic and it was a very relaxing Sunday afternoon.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"Henry’s family, Nancy and her husband.","ai":"Henry’s family, Nancy and her husband.","audio":"ques1Std1.mp3"},{"value":"Henry’s family, Nancy and her husband went on the picnic over the weekend.","ai":"Henry’s family, Nancy and her husband went on the picnic over the weekend.","audio":"ques1Std2.mp3"},{"value":"Nancy’s family and Henry’s family.","ai":"Nancy’s family and Henry’s family.","audio":""},{"value":"Henry, Kate, Nancy and her husband.","ai":"Henry, Kate, Nancy and her husband.","audio":""},{"value":"Henry, Kate and Nancy’s family.","ai":"Henry, Kate and Nancy’s family.","audio":""},{"value":"Henry’s family and their friends.","ai":"Henry’s family and their friends.","audio":""}],"ref":[],"ask":"1.
