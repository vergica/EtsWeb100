{"structure_type":"collector.dialogue","info":{"stid":"80013","value":"</p><p>Listen to the following passage about the film maker’s responsibility.</br></p><p>Recent research shows that there is a new pollutant in Los Angeles. The pollution comes from emissions during film making, either car exhaust, generator emissions or the fireworks used for special effects. The research shows that every year the film industry produces 140,000 tons of pollutants. </br></p><p>In addition to pollution, another concern facing China’s film industry is its negative impact on the general public. Many male characters in the movies are heavy smokers. They do not always wear a seat belt while driving and they often use the mobile phone while at the wheel. The situation with female characters is not much better. In some scenes involving a beautiful environment, they may tear up documents in anger and throw the pieces into a lake. Even worse, they make a lot of noise in public places. Some parents are worried about these rowdy actions and the negative impact on their children.</br></p><p>The situation is better in Japanese and Korean films. Most of the key characters in their films tend to be well-behaved. Maybe their film directors are more worried about the social effects of their movies. The Chinese government has recently published a set of guidelines for Chinese tourists going overseas. One of the guidelines is not to make a lot of noise in public places. Chinese film makers could learn from this good example. </br></p><p>When it comes to the pollution caused by Hollywood, we can think of some news reports about how the environment was damaged during the process of film making. One of the reports was about damage to some rock carvings that were several hundred years old. There was a lot of criticism of the damage. Film makers shouldn’t just consider box office and their profit. They should have social responsibilities and show respect for the environment, thus producing films to raise people’s awareness of the environment and animal rights.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"Pollution from emissions during film making and its negative impact on the general public.","ai":"Pollution from emissions during film making and its negative impact on the general public.","audio":"ques1Std1.mp3"},{"value":"They are pollution from emissions during film making and its negative effect on the general public.","ai":"They are pollution from emissions during film making and its negative effect on the general public.","audio":"ques1Std2.mp3"},{"value":"The two problems facing China’s film industry are pollution from emissions during the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","ai":"The two problems facing China’s film industry are pollution from emissions during the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","audio":""},{"value":"The two problems facing China’s film industry are pollution from emissions during film making and its negative impact on the general public.","ai":"The two problems facing China’s film industry are pollution from emissions during film making and its negative impact on the general public.","audio":""},{"value":"They are pollution from emissions during the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","ai":"They are pollution from emissions during the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","audio":""},{"value":"Pollution from emissions during the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","ai":"Pollution from emissions during the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","audio":""},{"value":"Pollution caused by the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","ai":"Pollution caused by the process of film making and its negative effect on the public.","audio":""},{"value":"Pollution caused by the process of film making and its negative impact on the general public.","ai":"Pollution caused by the process of film making and its negative impact on the general public.","audio":""},{"value":"Pollution from emissions and the negative impact on the general public during making a film.","ai":"Pollution from emissions and the negative impact on the general public during making a film.","audio":""},{"value":"Pollution from emissions and the negative effect on the general public during film making.","ai":"Pollution from emissions and the negative effect on the general public during film making.","audio":""},{"value":"The two problems facing China’s film industry are pollution from emissions during making a film and its negative impact on the public.","ai":"The two problems facing China’s film industry are pollution from emissions during making a film and its negative impact on the public.","audio":""},{"value":"Pollution caused by the process of making a film and its negative effect on the public.","ai":"Pollution caused by the process of making a film and its negative effect on the public.","audio":""},{"value":"Its negative impact on the general public and pollution from emissions during film making.","ai":"Its negative impact on the general public and pollution from emissions during film making.","audio":""},{"value":"They are its negative effect on the general public and pollution from emissions during film making.","ai":"They are its negative effect on the general public and pollution from emissions during film making.","audio":""},{"value":"The negative impact on the general public and pollution from emissions during making a film.","ai":"The negative impact on the general public and pollution from emissions during making a film.","audio":""},{"value":"The negative effect on the general public and pollution from emissions during making a film.","ai":"The negative effect on the general public and pollution from emissions during making a film.","audio":""}],"ref":[],"ask":"1.
