{"structure_type":"collector.dialogue","info":{"stid":"81408","value":"</p><p>Listen to the following passage about the Internet.</br></p><p>Personal computers and the Internet give people new choices about how to spend their time. Some may use this freedom to share less time with certain friends or family members, but new technology will also let them stay in closer touch with those they care most about. I know this from personal experience.</br></p><p>E-mail makes it easy to work at home, which is where I now spend most weekends and evenings. My working hours aren’t necessarily much shorter than they once were but I spend fewer of them at the office. This lets me share more time with my younger daughter than I might have if she’d been born before electronic mail became such a practical tool.</br></p><p>The Internet also makes it easy to share thoughts with a group of friends. Say you do something fun — see a great movie perhaps — and there are four or five friends who might want to hear about it. If you call each one, you might be tired of telling the story. But if you share with them online, things will be a whole lot easier.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"First, it gives people new choices about how to spend their time.
