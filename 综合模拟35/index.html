This way they can get a hands-on view of everything they learned and help them connect what they’ve learned to what they are seeing at the exhibit.Here are two fun and exciting educational field trip ideas for students.Post Office. A field trip to the local Post Office is a great way for students to compare the history of the postal service with the technology they use today. Students will leave the Post Office with a better understanding of how the mail connects everyone in the world.Pick Your Own Farms. A unique field trip idea is to take students on a trip to pick their own fruits and vegetables. Students will be exposed to agricultural topics and experience nature and how food grows.
