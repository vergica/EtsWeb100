With the popularity of the Internet, more and more people are inclined to choose online shopping. Not only could people select their favourite commodities such as clothes, food, cell phones through the Internet, but also they could enjoy some services of remote learning, online payment, online booking and so on.Online shopping has its particular advantages which are hardly found in traditional shopping. To begin with, online shopping is very time-saving. It is a desirable way to save much time for shopping. People needn’t spend a whole day to lounge from one store to another for shopping. Besides, online products are often less expensive, because the cost of online store is usually lower than a traditional one. Consumers can also compare prices from a variety of different online shops with greater ease. Moreover, shopping online gives people access to a wider range of options. People have great freedom of choices when they shop online. The Internet provides a far wider range of products than that people would find in any local stores.It is true that online shopping will appeal to more consumers in the near future, though it is also full of threats of online fraud and delivery problems."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/2608533cb9b7854a7472cd85b58bd284/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
