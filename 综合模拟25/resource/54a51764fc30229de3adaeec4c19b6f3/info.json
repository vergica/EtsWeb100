The day is a national holiday which is set aside each year as a time to give thanks to God for our blessing. Story has it that the first English settlers in Massachusetts started the custom. According to the story, 102 Pilgrims left England and arrived in Massachusetts on a ship called <span class=\"italic\">The Mayflower</span> in December, 1620. It was a cruel winter for them, and only about 50 people survived among 102. Fortunately, the local American Indians were kind-hearted. They gave the survivors necessities and taught them to hunt, fish and farm. The next year, the survivors had a good harvest. And they planned a large feast to give thanks. During the feast, they invited their Indian friends to join them to share in the bounties of the land. It is said that the feast lasted for 3 days, and many different kinds of activities were held, such as wrestling, racing, singing, dancing and so on. And many of them are still popular today. </br></p><p>Since the day is set aside for giving thanks, it has also become a traditional family day. Large dinners with many relatives around are common throughout America on this special day.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 How did the local American Indians help the first English settlers?</br>ets_th2 Do you celebrate Thanksgiving Day?
