They build their homes about 4.6m above the river, an important feature for the safety of the young. It is called the hoatzin.In appearance, the birds of both sexes look very much alike with brown on the back and cream and red on the underside. The head is small, with a large set of features on the top, bright red eyes, and blue skin. They are like the common birds, cuckoos. Its most striking feature, though, is only found in the young.Baby hoatzins have a claw on the leading edge of each wing and another at the end of each wing tip. Using these four claws, together with the beak, they can climb about in the bushes, looking very much like primitive birds must have done.

If I keep a bird at home, I can sometimes talk with it and listen to it singing for relaxation. Besides, keeping a bird can help me get rid of sadness. It would be glad to see a bird jumping and singing happily when I feel sad or annoyed. Therefore, I’d like to keep a bird at home.", "Yes. Here are my reasons. First, I enjoy spending my free time with birds. I once had a bird in my childhood, but it died later. Now I'd like to keep another one since I have grown up and can look after it. Secondly, a bird can accompany me, just like my family member. My parents are always busy with their work. So it would be great if I have a bird to be with me at home.
