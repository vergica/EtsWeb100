Drawing on the advantages of these local operas, the new Peking opera came into being. Later, it gained popularity among the public. Peking opera gradually became the most influential style of opera in China and was named the “national treasure” of China.The characters staged in Peking opera are not based on the appearance of people in daily life.

In general, the roles on the stage are divided into four categories: Sheng, Dan, Jing and Chou. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera’s stage.
