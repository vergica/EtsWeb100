[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>There are times when people are so tired that they fall asleep almost anywhere. We can see a lot of people sleeping on the bus or train on the way home from work in the evenings. A man will be reading the newspaper, and seconds later it appears as if he is trying to eat it. Or he will fall asleep on the shoulder of a stranger sitting next to him. Another place where unplanned short sleep goes on is in the lecture hall where a student will start snoring so loudly that the professor has to ask another student to shake the sleeper awake.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
