Some of the common causes of house fires are familiar to everyone, while others may surprise you. Identifying and lowering these risks help you lower your chance of house fire, keeping your family and property safer. Here are some common causes of house fires. First, cooking fires are among the most common types of house fires, causing around 49 percent of all residential fires. Most kitchen fires start when a homeowner leaves food cooking unsupervised on a stove or in an oven. By the time the fire is discovered, it’s usually too late. Second, heating and cooling appliances of various types are the second leading cause of residential fires, responsible for over 12 percent of all home fires. Third, despite smoking accounting for far fewer house fires than cooking accidents, it remains the leading cause of house fire deaths. Smoking in bed is especially dangerous and should always be avoided at all costs.Even if you do everything right, you still might find yourself facing a house fire someday, so you need to learn how to prevent them."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/53be055b8e0dd0484a348dae468e4d4a/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
