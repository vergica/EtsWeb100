The CEO of Meta, formerly called Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg is one of them. He can speak fluent Chinese. And it is reported that the granddaughter of Donald Trump the former president of America started to learn Chinese at a very young age. However, it is commonly agreed that Chinese is quite difficult to learn.But why do so many people learn it? I think the number one reason is that Chinese is the most widely-spoken language in the world. Learn to speak it and you can speak with hundreds of millions of people around the world. But there are other reasons. Business people who speak Chinese have a huge advantage in tapping into the Chinese market. It is much easier for them to develop all-important relationships if they can speak Chinese. In addition, with thousands of years of history, China has a culture of great splendor which is endlessly fascinating. Whether your interests are in history, architecture, music or cuisine, a wide knowledge of Chinese will definitely enhance your understanding of Chinese culture.So I suggest foreigners start to learn Chinese!

But defining what it means to be a good parent is undoubtedly very tricky, particularly since children respond differently to the same style of parenting.

Fortunately, there’s another sort of parent that’s a bit easier to describe: a patient parent. Children of every age benefit from patient parenting. Still, while every parent would like to be patient, this is no easy task. Sometimes parents get exhausted and frustrated and are unable to maintain a tolerant and composed style with their kids.
