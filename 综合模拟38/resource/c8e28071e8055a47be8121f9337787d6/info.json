[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">Gordon is a fifteen-year-old British boy at an international school in Shanghai. His parents work for a British company that has recently opened an office there. Gordon really enjoys his new school. But the problem is that the school is 15 kilometers away from where the family lives. His parents were very worried about how Gordon was going to get to school, so for the first week they took Gordon by car. However, when they had to make sure that Gordon arrived at school at 8, they were late for work.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">Gordon is quite keen to cycle, but Mother will not allow that because she is concerned about the heavy traffic on the roads. The taxi is quite expensive and it's usually difficult to get one in rush hour. There isn't direct subway route between his school and his home. Going by bus seems to be the best solution. Buses are cheaper and more frequent. There are other students on the bus and so he has the opportunity to talk with his friends. Gordon now enjoys his journey to school.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 Why does Gordon choose bus to go to school?</br>ets_th2 What is the main cause for the heavy traffic in Shanghai in your opinion?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 Why does Gordon choose bus to go to school?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 What is the main cause for the heavy traffic in Shanghai in your opinion?","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
