[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following passage about the distinction between schooling and education.</br></p><p>It is commonly believed in the United States that school is where people go to get an education. Nevertheless, it has been said that today children interrupt their education to go to school. The distinction between schooling and education implied by this remark is important.</br></p><p>Education is much more open-ended and all-inclusive than schooling. Education can take place anywhere, whether in the shower or in the job, whether in a kitchen or a tractor. The agents of education can range from a revered grandparent to the people debating politics on the radio, from a child to a distinguished scientist.</br></p><p>Whereas schooling has a certain predictability, education quite often produces surprises. A chance conversation with a stranger may lead a person to discover how little is known of other religions. Education, then, is a very broad, inclusive term. People are engaged in education from infancy on. It is a lifelong process, a process that starts long before the start of school and one that should be an integral part of oneâ€™s entire life. Schooling, on the other hand, is a specific, formalized process. Throughout a country, children arrive at school at approximately the same time, take assigned seats, are taught by an adult, use similar textbooks, do homework, take exams, and so on.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What is the distinction between schooling and education?</br>ets_th2 What impact does education have on you?
