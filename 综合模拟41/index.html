The camp was situated in an area close to a long, sandy beach.The days at the camp were long and I had to get up at 6:30, and was not usually in bed before midnight. I often had no time to eat lunch, except perhaps for a sandwich. I taught swimming in the morning and basketball in the afternoon. I also spent my evenings with these children, playing games, watching videos and singing. One of the reasons I was accepted for the job was that I can play the guitar. Generally my happiest times during the day were after dinner when the whole group went to the beach and chatted and sang.The whole experience has made me think seriously about teaching as a job in the future.
