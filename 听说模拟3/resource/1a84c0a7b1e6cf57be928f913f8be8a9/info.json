[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following passage about the influence of the snow in different countries.</br></p><p>It’s interesting that the arrival of snow has different effects on people in different countries. For some countries it is an important happening to celebrate each year, while for others it is a disaster.</br></p><p>However, Britain is between these two kinds, which never receives snow regularly or in the same quantities every year. For it, the arrival of snow quite simply creates problems. The roads are blocked, and trains and buses have to stop in the middle of the way. Phone calls become difficult and the post takes more time than usual. There are also certain shortages — bread, vegetables and other things — not because they can no longer be produced or sent to shops, but mainly because people are frightened and store up food “just for fear that something bad would happen”.</br></p><p>But why does snow have this effect? It is simply because there is not enough planning and preparation. It takes money to buy equipment to deal with snow and ice, for example, snow ploughs and machines to spread salt. The reason why a country like Britain does not buy snow ploughs is that they are only used for a few days in any one year, and that money could be more useful for other necessary things.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What’s the reason why the British don’t buy snow ploughs? </br>ets_th2 Do you think snow has a great effect on our country?
