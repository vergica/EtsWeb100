To grasp meaning from a range of media forms, it is vital to be media literate. This means that one must be able to question and assess the content of many media forms.

For the first viewing, turn off the sound and watch the picture closely. Focus on techniques used to construct the images. These include lighting, color, close-ups and camera angles. Next, listen to the sound without looking at the picture. Note the types of sounds and any music used. Then think about the type of mood or scene these sounds and images create.</br><\/p><p>In later viewings, focus on who or what is included in the advertisement. Listen to the dialogue and note what words are used. Do any of them lead to a particular response? Answering these questions will help to identify the message and values that the developers of the advertisement are trying to convey.
