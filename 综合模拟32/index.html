Books are of great significance in our life, as they are the ones who never leave us, no matter what.

In my childhood, my parents spent a lot of time reading with me. As time goes by, I’ve developed a habit of reading different kinds of books and the ability to tell good books from the ones that are not worth reading.I’d like to recommend Julius Caesar to you. It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It’s all about relationships, culture and society. It has exhibited a picture of ancient Rome that was male-dominated. It has revealed what men actually did towards females and the upper classes to the lower classes of society.The language and the structure of the book are impressive.
