[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about lightning.</br></p><p>Lightning strikes in many parts of the world. Lightning is an electric charge in a thunderstorm that is powerful enough to hurt or kill people. Here are a few basic safety rules to follow if you find yourself in a thunderstorm.</br></p><p>First, find shelter. Get inside a building or a car. Don’t stand under a tree. If you’re in a car, stay away from metal surfaces that can conduct electricity. Lightning can strike as far away as 16 kilometers from the center of the storm. Just because lightning and thunder seem far away, you should not assume that there is no danger. Remember that lightning will generally strike the highest place in an area. Don’t climb trees or play outside during a thunderstorm.</br></p><p>If you’re inside, don’t talk on the phone. Lightning can travel through the telephone wires and strike you while you’re talking. Turn off TVs, computers, and other appliances and stay away from them. Water is also a conductor of electricity. Don’t take a shower and stay away from sinks. Practice these safety rules and use your common sense to stay safe.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 List two of the things mentioned in the passage that we should avoid doing in a thunderstorm.</br>ets_th2 What kind of weather do you like most?
