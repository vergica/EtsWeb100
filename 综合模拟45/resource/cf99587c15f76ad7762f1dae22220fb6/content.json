That is, this person is using family the way it was used one hundred and fifty years ago when the majority of Americans were farmers. In that earlier time, of course, three or more generations lived under one roof â€” grandparents, their children, their children's spouses, and their children and their children's children. Now, this kind of family can also be called an extended family, while a nuclear family includes only parents and their children.<\/p><p>But family is a very vague word. As a result, the expression immediate family has come into use. It means something between the narrowest use of family and the broadest one: usually the grandparents, their children, and their children's children. <\/p>","stid":"284040","audio":"content.mp3"}}
