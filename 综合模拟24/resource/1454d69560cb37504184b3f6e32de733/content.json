Here I’d like to talk about how to prepare for a trip.</br><\/p><p>First, research the place where you’re going to see what the weather is like and what things you can do there. Second, if you plan to travel aboard, make sure that you know the local language at least a little, or else it will turn into an awkward situation. Third, check the economic, social and political situation of your destination country before you travel. Make sure you have all the necessary legal documents. Last but not least, I’d like to give you two tips about packing for a trip. The first tip is to pack your suitcase with only the necessary items. If you pack basically everything you own thinking you will need it, you will be adding too much weight to your bag. The second tip is to keep your most important items in your handbag. It’s a good way to lessen the chances of losing important stuff while on vacation.","stid":"81386","audio":"content.mp3"}}
