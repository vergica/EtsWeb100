Parents raising five or more children were common. Over the years the size of the family has decreased. One reason for this is an increase in the cost of living. On average, children attend schools for more years than they used to, making them financially dependent on their families longer. Moreover, children nowadays are better dressed and have more money to spend on entertainment. The parents usually take the responsibility for all the expenses. Meanwhile, families are less close than they used to be. More and more American mothers work away from home. The break up of the family occurs when the parents get divorced. A lot of children in the U.S. live part of their young lives with only one parent. Broken families usually result in problems for children and parents alike. Children blame themselves when their parents separate. They grow up feeling unsettled as they are moved back and forth between parents. Usually one parent takes the responsibility for raising the children. These single parents must care for the children’s emotional and psychological needs while also supporting them financially."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/213629ec118fc1c33dea0d45f64ac2fc/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.

For those who live in the countryside, their families are becoming smaller and smaller. Young people move to the city for work and make a new family in the city. And the old people still stay in the countryside. As for the people live in the city, most families have only one child. The children feel lonely as they don’t have sisters or brothers to share their happiness and sadness.", "In the past, Chinese families were always poor. A lot of children suffered from hunger and couldn’t get enough education. Now, the situation is getting better and better. Most of the Chinese families have enough food, clothing and good health care. People don’t feel crowded or noisy at homes because most families have big houses. People’s life is getting much better, compared to the past.", "With the development of the whole country, Chinese families are changing in some ways compared to the past. First, most families have only one or two children nowadays. Children live with their parents only, not with their other relatives anymore. Family numbers become smaller and smaller. Second, people spend more time on entertainment. Many families would go traveling on weekends, but not stay at home.
