These birds are considered to be more intelligent and active than other bird species as they have a talent of mimicking the sounds they are exposed to. Also, they have an average life span of around 60 years. Therefore, parrots are considered to be the most charming species of birds on the earth.There are over 300 species of parrots in different regions of the world. Most of the parrots are found in the tropical areas and places with a warm and humid climate such as India and Brazil. They feed on insects, nuts, fruits and tiny seeds.They are very friendly birds and people love to keep them as pets in their houses. However, keeping them as pets requires a lot of care and patience, and they need proper attention and love from people.
