And they must have realized how difficult it is to write a good children's book. Either the author has aimed too high, so that children can't follow the story, or seems to be talking down to the readers.<\/p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The best children's books keep a balance between these two: to satisfy both the child who hears the story and the adult who reads it. However, there are very few books like this, so the problem of finding a suitable bedtime story is not easy to solve. If you leave children to choose what they like to read in a bookshop or library, they will have a look at the books full of stories and jokes, which will worry teachers and right-thinking parents. Perhaps, we parents should stop forcing our children to accept our taste in reading.<\/p>","stid":"284068","audio":"content.mp3"}}
