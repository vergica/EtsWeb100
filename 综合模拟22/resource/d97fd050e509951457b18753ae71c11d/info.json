[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following passage about a kind of bird, hoatzin.</br></p><p>Along the river banks of the Amazon and the Orinoco there lives a bird that swims before it can fly, flies like a fat chicken, eats green leaves, has the stomach of a cow and has claws on its wings when young. They build their homes about 4.6m above the river, an important feature for the safety of the young. It is called the hoatzin.</br></p><p>In appearance, the birds of both sexes look very much alike with brown on the back and cream and red on the underside. The head is small, with a large set of features on the top, bright red eyes, and blue skin. They are like the common birds, cuckoos. Its most striking feature, though, is only found in the young.</br></p><p>Baby hoatzins have a claw on the leading edge of each wing and another at the end of each wing tip. Using these four claws, together with the beak, they can climb about in the bushes, looking very much like primitive birds must have done. When the young hoatzins have learned to fly, they lose their claws.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 What do young hoatzins use to climb about in the bushes?</br>ets_th2 Would you like to keep a bird at home?
