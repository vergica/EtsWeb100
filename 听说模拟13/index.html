Through a process of experimenting and documenting, we can find out how different parts of the natural world work. This is called the scientific process, or scientific method.The scientific process can be broken down into steps. The first step is to raise a question about something you have observed in the natural world. The wording you use for the question is very important. A question must be objective — it can’t deal with values or feelings.After you establish a question, create a statement of what you expect to happen during an experiment. Suppose your question is “What will happen to the seeds if I change the temperature they are kept at before I plant them?” Your statement might be “The higher the temperature at which I keep the seeds, the quicker I expect them to come up.”The next step is to write a procedure for your experiment. This will include all the steps needed to carry out the experiment. Then conduct your experiment. After completing the experiment, record your results and draw a conclusion based on the results. Sometimes your conclusion will prove your statement to be wrong. That’s OK! You will still have learned something on your path of discovery."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/855d9fc0c10414781681250e4a4785c3/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
