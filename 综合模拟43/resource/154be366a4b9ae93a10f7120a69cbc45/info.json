[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">You surely are not surprised to be told that you usually listen to music not only with your ears but with your whole body. Few people can listen to music that is more or less familiar without moving their body or, more specifically, some part of their body.

Strange as this behavior may be, there is a very good reason for it. One cannot obtain all possible enjoyment from music unless he participates, so to speak, in its performance. The listener feels himself into the music with more or less pronounced motions of his body.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The muscles of the body actually participate in the mental process of thinking in the same way, but this participation is less obvious because it is less pronounced. </p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 Why do most people move their body when listening to music that is more or less familiar?</br>ets_th2 What do you usually do when you listen to the music?
