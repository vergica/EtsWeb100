[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about the history of the United States.</br></p><p>Compared to the history of China, the history of the United States is quite short. It began little more than 200 years ago. In 1776, 13 colonies located on the eastern coast of North America declared independence and fought a revolution against the British. In 1783 the colonists won the revolution and gained their independence. After the revolution, the United States bought a large section of country from Napoleon of France. This purchase doubled the size of the United States. Napoleon needed money for his European wars. If he hadnâ€™t needed that money, the United States might have stayed a small country. Texas and most of what is now the southwestern part of the United States belonged to Mexico. The people of Texas fought a revolution against Mexico. They became independent and joined the United States. Later, the United States and Mexico went to war. If Mexico had defeated the United States in that war, California and New Mexico would have been part of Mexico today.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 After the revolution against the Britain, what did the United States do to make its land double size?</br>ets_th2 What else do you know about the United States?
