[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about the scientific process.</br></p><p>The world is full of new things to discover. Through a process of experimenting and documenting, we can find out how different parts of the natural world work. This is called the scientific process, or scientific method.</br></p><p>The scientific process can be broken down into steps. The first step is to raise a question about something you have observed in the natural world. The wording you use for the question is very important. A question must be objective — it can’t deal with values or feelings.</br></p><p>After you establish a question, create a statement of what you expect to happen during an experiment. Suppose your question is “What will happen to the seeds if I change the temperature they are kept at before I plant them?” Your statement might be “The higher the temperature at which I keep the seeds, the quicker I expect them to come up.”</br></p><p>The next step is to write a procedure for your experiment. This will include all the steps needed to carry out the experiment. Then conduct your experiment. After completing the experiment, record your results and draw a conclusion based on the results. Sometimes your conclusion will prove your statement to be wrong. That’s OK! You will still have learned something on your path of discovery.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"askall","code_value":"ets_th1 List two of the steps that follow “raising a question” in the scientific process.</br>ets_th2 Describe an experiment you have ever carried out in or out of class.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask1","code_value":"ets_th1 List two of the steps that follow “raising a question” in the scientific process.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"},{"code_id":"ask2","code_value":"ets_th2 Describe an experiment you have ever carried out in or out of class.","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
