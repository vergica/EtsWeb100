Each summer, millions of Americans drive to the countryside where they find places to camp. The national parks, many of which are in the mountains, are favorite camping places. Campers enjoy the fresh air, the lakes and the forests which they find in these parks. Campers hike, swim and fish. They can also find many kinds of animals and plants in the parks. Mostly, campers relax. They enjoy a change from their busy lives in the city. Some campers have trailers which they drive or pull behind their cars to their camp sites. Trailers are like houses on wheels. They have many conveniences which people have in their homes, such as electricity and hot water. But most campers don’t have trailers. They camp in tents which they set up in their camp sites. Campers in tents don’t have the conveniences that campers in trailers have. Tent campers just enjoy a very simple life."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/8922c76718344edff9f80f801fc53e75/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.
