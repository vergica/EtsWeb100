The day is a national holiday which is set aside each year as a time to give thanks to God for our blessing. Story has it that the first English settlers in Massachusetts started the custom. According to the story, 102 Pilgrims left England and arrived in Massachusetts on a ship called <span class=\"italic\">The Mayflower</span> in December, 1620. It was a cruel winter for them, and only about 50 people survived among 102. Fortunately, the local American Indians were kind-hearted. They gave the survivors necessities and taught them to hunt, fish and farm. The next year, the survivors had a good harvest. And they planned a large feast to give thanks. During the feast, they invited their Indian friends to join them to share in the bounties of the land. It is said that the feast lasted for 3 days, and many different kinds of activities were held, such as wrestling, racing, singing, dancing and so on. And many of them are still popular today. </br></p><p>Since the day is set aside for giving thanks, it has also become a traditional family day. Large dinners with many relatives around are common throughout America on this special day.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"They gave necessities to them and taught them to hunt, fish and farm.","ai":"They gave necessities to them and taught them to hunt, fish and farm.","audio":"ques1Std1.mp3"},{"value":"The local American Indians gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them how to hunt, fish and farm.","ai":"The local American Indians gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them how to hunt, fish and farm.","audio":"ques1Std2.mp3"},{"value":"The local American Indians gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them how to hunt, fish and farm.","ai":"The local American Indians gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them how to hunt, fish and farm.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave them necessities and taught them to hunt, farm and fish.","ai":"They gave them necessities and taught them to hunt, farm and fish.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them to fish, hunt and farm.","ai":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them to fish, hunt and farm.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them to farm, fish and hunt.","ai":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them to farm, fish and hunt.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them to fish, farm and hunt.","ai":"They gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them to fish, farm and hunt.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them to farm, hunt and fish.","ai":"They gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them to farm, hunt and fish.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them to hunt, fish and farm.","ai":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them to hunt, fish and farm.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them how to fish, hunt and farm.","ai":"They gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them how to fish, hunt and farm.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave necessities to them and taught them to fish, hunt and farm.","ai":"They gave necessities to them and taught them to fish, hunt and farm.","audio":""},{"value":"They gave necessities to them and taught them to farm, fish and hunt.","ai":"They gave necessities to them and taught them to farm, fish and hunt.","audio":""},{"value":"The local American Indians gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them how to farm, hunt and fish.","ai":"The local American Indians gave the first English settlers necessities and taught them how to farm, hunt and fish.","audio":""},{"value":"The local American Indians gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them how to fish, farm and hunt.","ai":"The local American Indians gave necessities to the first English settlers and taught them how to fish, farm and hunt.","audio":""},{"value":"They taught them how to hunt, fish and farm, and gave them necessities.","ai":"They taught them how to hunt, fish and farm, and gave them necessities.","audio":""},{"value":"The local American Indians taught them to hunt, farm and fish, and gave them necessities.","ai":"The local American Indians taught them to hunt, farm and fish, and gave them necessities.","audio":""},{"value":"The local American Indians taught the first English settlers to fish, hunt and farm, and gave them necessities.","ai":"The local American Indians taught the first English settlers to fish, hunt and farm, and gave them necessities.","audio":""},{"value":"They taught the first English settlers to fish, farm and hunt, and gave necessities to them.","ai":"They taught the first English settlers to fish, farm and hunt, and gave necessities to them.","audio":""},{"value":"They taught them to farm, fish and hunt, and gave them necessities.","ai":"They taught them to farm, fish and hunt, and gave them necessities.","audio":""},{"value":"The local American Indians taught them how to farm, hunt and fish, and gave necessities to them.","ai":"The local American Indians taught them how to farm, hunt and fish, and gave necessities to them.","audio":""}],"ref":[],"ask":"1.
