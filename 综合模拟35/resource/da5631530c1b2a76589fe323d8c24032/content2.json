For instance, if they are learning about dinosaurs, the best way to wrap up the unit is to go on a field trip to a local dinosaur exhibit at the museum. This way they can get a hands-on view of everything they learned and help them connect what they’ve learned to what they are seeing at the exhibit.</br></p><p>Here are two fun and exciting educational field trip ideas for students.</br></p><p>Post Office. A field trip to the local Post Office is a great way for students to compare the history of the postal service with the technology they use today. Students will leave the Post Office with a better understanding of how the mail connects everyone in the world.</br></p><p>Pick Your Own Farms. A unique field trip idea is to take students on a trip to pick their own fruits and vegetables. Students will be exposed to agricultural topics and experience nature and how food grows.
