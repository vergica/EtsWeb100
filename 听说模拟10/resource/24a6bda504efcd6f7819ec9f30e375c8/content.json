There are mainly two reasons. First, the air in the city is badly polluted. Sometimes the dirty air invaded us and we could hardly breathe. Some people even get diseases because of the polluted air.

Several factors are responsible for it. First, winter is my favourite season. When winter comes, our Spring Festival is approaching, and all the family can get together and play in the snow-covered field. Second, snow can bring us a lot of fun. I like making the snowman and play snowballs as well as fighting with my cousins. Since we are not in the same city, we seldom have the chance to play together. Lastly, I like the view of a vast expanse of whiteness, bringing me the feel of tranquility, which can purify people’s hearts.","ai":"<\/p><p>I like snowy days most.

Lightning is an electric charge in a thunderstorm that is powerful enough to hurt or kill people. Here are a few basic safety rules to follow if you find yourself in a thunderstorm.</br><\/p><p>First, find shelter. Get inside a building or a car. Don’t stand under a tree. If you’re in a car, stay away from metal surfaces that can conduct electricity. Lightning can strike as far away as 16 kilometers from the center of the storm. Just because lightning and thunder seem far away, you should not assume that there is no danger. Remember that lightning will generally strike the highest place in an area. Don’t climb trees or play outside during a thunderstorm.</br><\/p><p>If you’re inside, don’t talk on the phone. Lightning can travel through the telephone wires and strike you while you’re talking. Turn off TVs, computers, and other appliances and stay away from them. Water is also a conductor of electricity. Don’t take a shower and stay away from sinks. Practice these safety rules and use your common sense to stay safe.","stid":"43594","audio":"content.mp3"}}
