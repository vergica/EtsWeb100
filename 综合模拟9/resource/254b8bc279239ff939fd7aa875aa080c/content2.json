{"structure_type":"collector.dialogue","info":{"stid":"51481","value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about the television networks in the U.S.</br></p><p>The most common form of entertainment in the U.S. is television. Nearly everyone watches television at some regular time in their daily lives, whether in the morning, at night or on weekends. Most families have color televisions and many have more than one set. Since its beginning, the television industry in the U.S. has been controlled by three companies. Those companies have formed networks of television stations in cities across the country. Each station televises its company’s television programs. The three national networks are ABC, American Broadcasting Company, CBS, Columbia Broadcasting System and NBC, National Broadcasting Company. Each network has news features, dramatic presentations, comedies and sports events. Each network competes for a larger percentage of the television audience by trying to present programs with wide popular appeal. The programs are financed by advertising. Companies pay the television networks to display their products on television. The more popular a program is, the higher the network can charge a company for commercials during the program. There is also a public television network. It has no commercials. Instead it receives financial support from the government, some private corporations and individual donations.","image":"","audio":"content.mp3","video":"","question":[{"std":[{"value":"They are ABC, CBS and NBC.","ai":"They are ABC, CBS and NBC.","audio":"ques1Std1.mp3"},{"value":"The three major television networks in the U.S. are ABC, CBS and NBC.","ai":"The three major television networks in the U.S. are ABC, CBS and NBC.","audio":"ques1Std2.mp3"},{"value":"The three national networks are ABC, American Broadcasting Company, CBS, Columbia Broadcasting System and NBC, National Broadcasting Company.","ai":"The three national networks are ABC, American Broadcasting Company, CBS, Columbia Broadcasting System and NBC, National Broadcasting Company.","audio":""},{"value":"They are ABC, American Broadcasting Company, CBS, Columbia Broadcasting System and NBC, National Broadcasting Company.","ai":"They are ABC, American Broadcasting Company, CBS, Columbia Broadcasting System and NBC, National Broadcasting Company.","audio":""}],"ref":[],"ask":"1.
