Students are always asking, “Why do I have to learn math?” A trip to the bank will show them how the math skills they are learning in school can be applied to everyday life when they grow up. Bank tellers can show students how to write a personal check, how to open a bank account and use a debit card.

For instance, if they are learning about dinosaurs, the best way to wrap up the unit is to go on a field trip to a local dinosaur exhibit at the museum. This way they can get a hands-on view of everything they learned and help them connect what they’ve learned to what they are seeing at the exhibit.</br><\/p><p>Here are two fun and exciting educational field trip ideas for students.</br><\/p><p>Post Office. A field trip to the local Post Office is a great way for students to compare the history of the postal service with the technology they use today. Students will leave the Post Office with a better understanding of how the mail connects everyone in the world.</br><\/p><p>Pick Your Own Farms. A unique field trip idea is to take students on a trip to pick their own fruits and vegetables. Students will be exposed to agricultural topics and experience nature and how food grows.
