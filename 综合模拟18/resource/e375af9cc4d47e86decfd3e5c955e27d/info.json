[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>Mount Rainier is a large active volcano located in the Mount Rainier National Park in west central Washington. It is considered as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. The 14,411-foot-high mountain is often said to create its own weather. It reaches into the atmosphere and interrupts the flow of moist air masses from the Pacific Ocean. This results in great amounts of rain and snowfall. During the winter from 1971 to 1972, 1,122 inches of snow fell on Mount Rainier, which was a world record.</p>","code_class":"","code_type":"txt"}]
