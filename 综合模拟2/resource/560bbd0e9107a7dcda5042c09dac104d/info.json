[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"</p><p>Listen to the following speaker talking about American colleges and universities.</br></p><p>There are thousands of colleges and universities in the United States. Nearly half of the high school graduates in America go on to college. Most students, like Bob and Jenny, go to large universities. These are state universities. Some of them have 40,000 or more students. There are also many small universities with only a few hundred students. </br></p><p>Large universities have many teaching buildings, each building for a particular subject. The buildings are in the university campus. Often, students must go from one class in one building to the next class in another building across the campus. They may have only a few minutes between classes to go from one building to another. </br></p><p>When students begin university, they must take classes in many different subjects. These are the required courses. English and math are usually required courses. In addition, a history and a science course are often required, too. Bob and Jenny will mainly study these required courses during their first year. Later, they will specialize and take courses in one subject, that is, their major subject.
