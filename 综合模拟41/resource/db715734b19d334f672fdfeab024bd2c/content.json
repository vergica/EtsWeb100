The camp was situated in an area close to a long, sandy beach.<\/p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The days at the camp were long and I had to get up at 6:30, and was not usually in bed before midnight. I often had no time to eat lunch, except perhaps for a sandwich. I taught swimming in the morning and basketball in the afternoon. I also spent my evenings with these children, playing games, watching videos and singing. One of the reasons I was accepted for the job was that I can play the guitar. Generally my happiest times during the day were after dinner when the whole group went to the beach and chatted and sang.<\/p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">The whole experience has made me think seriously about teaching as a job in the future. <\/p>","stid":"284103","audio":"content.mp3"}}
