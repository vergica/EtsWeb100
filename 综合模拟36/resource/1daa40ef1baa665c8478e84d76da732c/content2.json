We want people to feel happy with their lives!\" says Dr. Kataria. There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide.<\/p><p style=\"text-indent:2em;\">So, what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous about it, to be honest — I wasn't keen on the idea of laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid. First, our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha,\" while looking at each other. Amazingly, it works. After ten minutes, everybody in the room was laughing for real — and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class, I was surprised by how relaxed and calm I felt. So, if you're upset about something at work or just fed up with your daily routine, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results!<\/p>","stid":"284075","audio":"content.mp3"}}
