Known as the “great transformation”, this ceremony marks a child’s passage from playful youngster to serious student.Kindergarten in Japan is a time for children to learn through play. This style of active learning cultivates their minds and bodies. Teachers design programs that develop social skills, the use of language, the expression of thoughts and feelings, and an awareness of the natural world. Teachers also help to prepare children for the next level of study. Although children have a great deal of playtime in kindergarten, they learn to settle down quickly and focus when it is time for a lesson.The great transformation represents this passage in the youngster’s life. The children behave themselves with politeness during this formal event. They march into the room in single file with their arms held against their sides. When they reach the row of chairs in the center of the room, they take a bow all together. They then sit down silently. A number of adults give short speeches, and then the dean awards each student a certificate. After the children recite a farewell speech or sing a song, the ceremony closes. The seriousness of the great transformation helps to prepare children for the intense learning that lies ahead."}, "qu1": {"audio": "resource/029496f43e5bc2bedf824192feb8366e/material/ques1askaudio.mp3", "text": "1.

Luckily I had a nice and patient English teacher, and she thought I have the potential to learn English well. She encouraged me to express myself in the English competition. And she also asked a foreign teacher to help me with my oral English. So a month later, when I was standing on the stage of the competition, I was confident to show my spoken English and I won the first place in this contest.", "The thing that impresses me the most in kindergarten is a stupid thing I did when I was four. One of my classmates suffered nosebleeds. He felt very bad, and then the teacher called his parents to pick him up. So he could go back home. After seeing this, I came up with an idea. I nipped my nose again and again to make it bleed. Finally, I succeeded and showed it to my teacher. But the teacher laughed and didn’t call my parents. She knew what I did! She told me to stay in school and be honest.", "The event which leaves the deepest impression on me is a warm story about my classmate Mary happened in my primary school. The place where I lived was a little bit far away from where Mary lived. One day, it was raining outside when we got ready to go home. Unfortunately, I didn’t carry an umbrella with me that day. However, Mary did. I planned to stay at school until the rain stopped. But Mary said we should help each other. At the end, she took me home first, and then she went back to her home."], "key": "The Most Impressive Event"}}, "1": {"title": "朗读句子", "text": ["1.
