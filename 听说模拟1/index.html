Usually, he watches television for quite a long time at night. He thinks it is so much fun because he really enjoys the characters in the program as well as the plots. Very often, he doesn’t go to bed until mid-night. He spends all night on the online games in his phone. He likes the game Minecraft best mainly because of its open-minded design. Of course, he considers online novels as his another choice to enjoy himself at midnight. All these TV shows and games make him forget the time. When it is nearly dawn, exhaustion puts him to bed. As a result, he gets sick. While looking after Xiao Ming, his mum keeps telling him “early to go to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise”.

To grasp meaning from a range of media forms, it is vital to be media literate. This means that one must be able to question and assess the content of many media forms. One method that can help a person to improve this skill is to record a single television advertisement and view it over and over.With each viewing, a person should pay attention to a single different technique used by the makers of the advertisement. For the first viewing, turn off the sound and watch the picture closely. Focus on techniques used to construct the images. These include lighting, color, close-ups and camera angles. Next, listen to the sound without looking at the picture. Note the types of sounds and any music used. Then think about the type of mood or scene these sounds and images create.In later viewings, focus on who or what is included in the advertisement. Listen to the dialogue and note what words are used. Do any of them lead to a particular response? Answering these questions will help to identify the message and values that the developers of the advertisement are trying to convey.
