[{"code_id":"value","code_value":"<p>When an American today says \"My family is coming to visit\", he or she is using family in the broad sense to include cousins, uncles, grandparents, or any other relatives who do not live with him or her.

In that earlier time, of course, three or more generations lived under one roof â€” grandparents, their children, their children's spouses, and their children and their children's children. Now, this kind of family can also be called an extended family, while a nuclear family includes only parents and their children.</p><p>But family is a very vague word.
